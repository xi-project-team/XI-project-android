Android Studio will be the IDE for the xi-project-android.

This is the beginning of a specification describing the basic Android 
mobile functional block of the xi-project. Later this will migrate to a 
MS-WORD doc or whatever. For now emacs and text are good enough.

Jody suggested that the initial droid code be simply a mobile client that
querys the xi-project-website with a "location". the location can be a plug-in
value or later it will be a GPS determined value. ZIP_CODE will be good for to
get things going.

While nothing is being done on the xi-website (server) site, a server stub will 
be created to respond to the xi-android (client) query. The query will be a 
URI (URL) request that uses location as the key. The xi-website (server) stub 
will return a JSON response. The server stub will implement an SQLLite3 db.

The JSON response will just be used to show that something came back in a
textview.

The xi_project-android code will be setup in a very generalized framework
that can be adapted as more details are specified. This includes generalized:
Activities
Fragments
Adapters
View-Builders
URI-Builders
DataCache SQLLite3 db
Resources
AndroidManifest.xml
and other good stuff
